    <p id="CaeliLieText">“Oh, and who are you related to?” You think of the leaders and three names come to your mind, there is Carl Linnaeus who is the main leader of the dome and the persons whose voice you heard on the emergency speakers. There is also Katherine Esau who is quiet, reserved, and grumpy. She is known for not letting people know much about her. Then there is Agnes Arber who is very nice and the favorite leader of the three, she is also very open about her life. All seem like ‘good’ options.
