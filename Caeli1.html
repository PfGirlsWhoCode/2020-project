    <p id="Caeli1Text">You stretch and get out of bed. Time to start the day! You pocket your science badge that you got for your job of taking care of the trees. You were one of the scientists trying to save the trees. You then do your chores and head outside your house(If you can call it a house) and hear the emergency speakers. They are so loud you cover your ears. The voice of Caeli’s leader is heard, this is no test. “...Oxygen is low, the trees are dying. There is no hope. This is the end of Caeli...” You knew this was going to happen but so soon? Luckily you saved up enough currency to buy enough oxygen tanks to survive for a while outside. You need to fix this! The first thing you need to do is gather the seeds, sounds easy enough. The first seed here in your own dome, you just need to get it from the leaders. You start walking to the office for the leaders but before you can enter a guard stops you. “The leaders are busy currently, you can wait for the dome to die with the rest of the other citizens.” You need to convince him that you can save the dome but how?
