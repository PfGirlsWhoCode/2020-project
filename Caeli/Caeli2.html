    <p id="Caeli2Text">You walk into the leaders meeting room, it is breathtaking compared to the other structures in the dome. Artwork covers the walls and little stone statues of trees give the feel of freedom. You see three people sitting in comfy looking chairs talking to each other and one of them is crying. They are the leaders. They don’t seem to notice you yet so you listen to them for a moment. “It’s alright Katherine Esau, there was nothing we could do. You don’t need to be tough anymore.” Says Agnes Arber. “We all knew it would happen one day or another.” Says Carl Linnaeus calmly. You need to talk to them now before it is too late. “Hey.” You say and they all jump. Katherine Esau stands up and wipes her tears and puts on her signature grumpy face. “Hey! You shouldn’t be here! How did you get Alan to let you in? Nevermind, I don’t care. Get out!” She says walking menacingly towards you. You take a step back and put your arms up. “I KNOW HOW TO SAVE THE WORLD!” You scream at them and Katherine Esau Stops in her tracks. “What did you say?” She asks. You say calmly “You know what I said.” She stops her tough person persona and looks at you curiously. “How?” They all ask at once. You recall all of your research about the outside world that you did in secret. “Oxygen in the air outside world’s air has been on a rise, it is still not breathable yet but the data is pointing us that South there is more oxygen in the air so there might be a small forest that way just like the legend of Terra!” You tell them. They start to laugh halfheartedly. “You are crazy to think that a legend like that is real!” Carl Linnaeus says. “Look, I wouldn’t come here if I didn’t think this could work. I know it sounds insane but it is the last hope we have!” You say. They look at each other. “Prove to us why we should change and not let the world we destroyed take its revenge.” Katherine Esau says.
