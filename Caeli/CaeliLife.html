    <p id="CaeliLifeText">“And why? If we live this time how long do we have before the next bad thing happens then what? Humans were never meant to survive. Nothing was ever meant for forever.” Agnes Arber says catching you off guard, she never acted like this before! Maybe she was never the nice one but she only acted that way for the crowds. “I agree with Agnes Arber. We might as well give up now before it gets even worse.” Katherine Esau says. “Now is the time to leave before you make a bigger fool of yourself.” Carl Linnaeus tells you. You don't want to give up so easily. “You don’t know how important lives are to most people! You are uncaring and I don’t need you to help others!” You yell at them. “Guards!” Yells Carl Linnaeus and a guard comes in shortly after to drag you off. Once outside you grab all of your oxygen tanks and try to hand them out to the people who want to survive. None of them take any oxygen tanks saying. “That won’t save us in the long run.” You finally give up and decide you don’t need to live longer than any of them and trash your oxygen tanks. This is the end of Caeli.
