    <p id="Fail2Text">The scientists of Aqua drag you off. “No please!” You scream but all the citizens of Aqua just look away and rush inside their rooms in the dome. You try to fight them off but you are not strong enough and just weaken yourself further. The scientists soon take you to a lab where they inject a weird chemical into you. “This shouldn’t hurt much yet.” One of the scientists says perhaps trying to comfort you. They then drag you off to the exit to the dome and kick you out with no oxygen tanks. You feel the oxygen leave you. You look over at the dome and see the scientists observing you making notes. You soon start seeing stars and then black out knowing you will never wake up again.
      The end.</p>
