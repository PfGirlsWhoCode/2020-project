    <p>The scientists of Aqua drag you off. “No please!” You scream but all the citizens of Aqua just look away and rush inside their homes. You try to fight them off but you are not strong enough and just weaken yourself further. The scientists soon take you to a lab where they inject a weird chemical into you. “This shouldn’t hurt much yet.” One of the scientists say perhaps trying to comfort you. They then drag you off to the exit to the dome and kick you out with no oxygen tanks. You feel like you are in sand and the sand is suffocating you. You scratch at your neck trying to get air in. You look over at the dome and see the scientists observing you making notes. You soon start seeing stars and then black out knowing you will never wake up again.
        The end.</p>
