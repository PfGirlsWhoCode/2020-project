    <p>It is the year 5023, the world is not like it used to be. Due to deforestation and other human related causes the world's oxygen was depleted in 4421. The last humans who survived created domes to save the last plants and humans. The domes often got into fights about how to run things. Aqua wanted to change with the world and started experiments to help humans adapt to their new habitat. Ignis wanted to run things like they did before the world ended and figure out a solution to the air problem. Caeli just wanted to stay in the domes. In the domes they were safe outside they were not. The domes ended up stopping trade between the other domes and were unwilling to allow other dome’s people in their domes. Now the dome’s trees are dying, There is no cure and no one knows how to save them...
      </p>
    <p>
      
      
      Reunite the domes; Caeli, Aqua, and Ignis and figure out if the outside world; Foedo can be saved by planting trees.
      Get all 4 seeds and spread the word of how to save the world!</p>
